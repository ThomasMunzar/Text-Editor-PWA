The goal of this project was to create a downloadable text editor. The user should be able to access your app site online, wrtie whatever they want and that app should keep everything they write in memory even if they refresh the page. When the user downloads the app, the content was what they wrote should be transfered over and they about to continue writing on their downloaded app even with out wifi.

## Learning Points

PWA's are extremely hard to understadn for me. I did do alot fo research and took alot of tutoring session to get this project done. The frustrating part for me was that I had it working perfectly, I deployed it to heroku and then the next day when I tried to test to see if it worked again, it did not. None of the content would stay on the page after a refresh and it was no longer downloading to my local device. I went to tutoring appointments to see if something was wrong with my code and they could not find anything. It wasnt till someone told me that once you download a PWA (in this case i was downloading localhost:3000) you need to uninstall it before you can download it again. So testing PWA's seems like it can be very finicky and frustrating. It is good i experience this frustration and someone who has worked with PWA's before was able to let me know I am not alot in this frustration. I am still very early in this learing experience so Im just happy it was not my code.
